        from various business departments that is presented in an understandable
        way, allowing managers to make better-informed decisions. One question

        top 10 elements you absolutely need. Whether you already have a defined

      <h1>Financial Report</h1>

      <p>
        The annual financial statement has been prepared in accordance with the
        Swiss GAAP FER 21 financial reporting guidelines for charitable and
        social non-profit organisations. For the statement of accounts, Swiss
        GAAP FER 21 stipulates that the year-end result is reported after
        changes in funds. Donations are assigned directly to the fund
        (allocation to funds reflected in income statement). Earmarked or
        non-earmarked donations contained in the fund will then be used in
        accordance with Swisscontact’s overall objective to finance project
        activities (use of funds reflected in income statement). This may be
        done during the year the donations are allocated, or else in subsequent
        reporting years. The cost structure and apportionment of administrative
        expenses, administrative programme expenses, and direct programme
        expenses comply with the ZEWO Foundation guidelines.
